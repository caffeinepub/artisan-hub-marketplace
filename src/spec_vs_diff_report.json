  "summary": "The diff implements all 7 requirements comprehensively. Two new legal document pages (Terms and Privacy Policy) were created with comprehensive placeholder content. The Layout component was updated with a footer containing links to both pages. Both ProfileSetupModal and ArtistRegistration forms now include required acceptance checkboxes with clickable links. The backend UserProfile model was extended with termsAccepted and privacyPolicyAccepted boolean fields, and validation logic was added to enforce acceptance. A migration module handles existing users gracefully. All acceptance criteria appear to be met.",

      "reason": "The diff includes a new migration.mo file that migrates old UserProfile records to the new schema by setting termsAccepted and privacyPolicyAccepted to false for existing users. While this is good engineering practice and aligns with the constraint about existing users, it was not explicitly requested in any requirement.",
