# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Enable artists to bulk upload images as products, offer donation options, and customize their store presentation with dedicated public store pages.

**Planned changes:**
- Add bulk image upload to artist dashboard where each image creates a separate product listing
- Introduce product type field to distinguish between regular products and donations
- Create donation setup flow with customizable amounts and descriptions
- Display products and donations in separate marketplace sections
- Add store settings for artists to customize store name, bio, banner, and social links
- Create public artist store pages showing all products/donations with custom branding
- Add navigation from marketplace product cards to individual artist stores

**User-visible outcome:** Artists can quickly upload multiple images at once to create product listings, set up donation options for supporters, customize their store appearance, and have a dedicated public store page. Buyers can browse products and donations separately, support artists through donations with custom amounts, and explore individual artist stores with personalized branding.
